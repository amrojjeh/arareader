## Definite and indefinite

Nouns are either definite or indefinite. Definite nouns refer to a specific thing, such as "he bought **the car**," whereas indefinite nouns don't, as in the example "he could not find **a car**."

In Arabic, most definite nouns are prefixed with ال. Examples are:

- البلدُ (the town)
- العذابُ (the punishment)
- الكتابُ (the book)

Proper nouns are nouns which are definite by their meaning. For instance, "Joseph" must refer to a specific person. So all the names given are definite:

- محمدٌ
- فاطمةُ
- ابراهيمُ

Note that some of them, such as محمدٌ, have a tanween, even though it's definite. And of course, none of them start with ال.

Indefinite nouns, on the other hand, end with a tanween most of the time. Examples are:

- بلدٌ (a town)
- عذابٌ (a muslim)
- كتابٌ (a book)

However, be aware that:

1) Depending on the context, any of the above words may end with something other than a dammah. This will be covered later, inshallah.
2) It's **impossible** for a word prefixed with the definite ال to also end with a tanween. However, an indefinite noun doesn't require tanween, and a definite one doesn't require ال. We'll learn about these cases later, inshallah.

Notice how we don't translate these as "the clear" or "a clear" in English, even though their definiteness varies. This is because adjectives in English don't express definiteness. We'll be covering this in lesson 3, inshallah.
