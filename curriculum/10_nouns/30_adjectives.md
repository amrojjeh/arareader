## Adjectives

In English, adjectives precede the noun as in "a **fast** car," however, in Arabic, they follow it: "القرآنُ الكريمُ" (the noble Quran). In addition, they must agree with the noun in four properties:

- Definiteness
- Gender
- Number
- Case

We'll be covering the other three properties later, inshallah.
