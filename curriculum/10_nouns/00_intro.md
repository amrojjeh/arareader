# Nouns and Adjectives

Nouns are words which refer to a person, place, or thing. The words "car," "Mike," "human," "America," and "idea" are all nouns.

Adjectives describe nouns. In the phrase "a fast car," fast is an adjective since it describes the noun "car."

In this chapter, I'll be learning how nouns and adjectives are represented in Arabic.
