## Equational Sentences

In English, a complete sentence requires a verb. So if I want to go from merely describing "the car" as "fast" to actually stating that the fact, I have to use the "to be" verb: the car **is** fast. Grammatically speaking, the word "fast" is a predicate, since it _states_ something about the subject (the car).

Verbs are not required in Arabic. I can say: القرآنُ كريمٌ (the Quran is noble).

The "to be" verb would simply be implied. Sentences which do not explicitly have any verb are called "equational sentences" since they equate two things: the predicate and the subject.

In an equational sentence, an Arabic predicate has to agree with the subject in three ways:

- Gender
- Number
- Case

However, it must *disagree* with the subject in terms of definiteness, which is why كريم is indefinite in the previous example.

This rule wouldn't be complete without an exception, however. How do I say "Muhammad is the Prophet" (peace be upon him), considering that both the subject and the predicate are definite in this case? I must add a pronoun separator: محمد هو الرسول. The word هو means "he," and by inserting it between the subject and the predicate, I can now equate a definite predicate with a definite subject.

Since I've not covered pronouns, you are not expected to remember this. I only mention this so there's no confusion.
