The curriculum is primarly based on Alan Jones's book *Arabic Through the Quran.* May Allah have mercy on him and and be pleased with his work.

# Assumptions

- You know the Arabic letters
- You know the Arabic diacritical marks (بَ، بِ، بُ، بْ، بٌ، بٍ، بً، بّ)
- You can pronounce Arabic words out loud (such as بابٌ)

Later on inshallah, I'll also teach the alphabet, but for now I recommend these resources:
